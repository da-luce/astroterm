## Building

> Ncurses detection is spotty on some systems, and you may need to install
> [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) in order
> for Meson to find it. You may install via [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ncurses) on MacOS.

### Requirements

- Linux or macOS
- A C compiler
- ncurses library
- [`meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) 1.4.0 or newer
- [`ninja`](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja) 1.8.2 or newer
- [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or [`curl`](https://curl.se/)
- [`xxd`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd)

### Installation

Clone this repo in your local system and enter the project directory

```sh
git clone https://github.com/da-luce/starsaver && cd starsaver
```

Run the install script

```sh
sh install.sh
```

The following binary is produced

```sh
./build/starsaver
```

To add to the default install location, run

```sh
meson install -C build
```

> Note, after rebuilding any changes, rerunning `meson install` is required

### [Known issues](https://github.com/da-luce/starsaver/issues)

### Testing

Run `meson test` within the build directory.

### Coverage

```bash
meson test
ninja coverage
```

## Usage

After installing _starsaver_, simply run `starsaver` to invoke it.

```bash
starsaver
```

Pressing <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>ESC</kbd> will exit.

### Options

The `--help` flag will display all supported options. 

#### Example

Say we wanted to view the sky at 5:00 AM (Eastern) on July 16, 1969‚Äîthe morning
of the Apollo 11 launch at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. We would run:

```sh
starsaver --latitude 28.573469 --longitude -80.651070 --datetime 1969-7-16T9:32:00
```

If we then wanted to display all stars with a magnitude brighter than or equal
to 5.0 and add color, we would add `--threshold 5.0 --color` as options.

If you simply want the current time, don't specify the `--datetime` option and
_starsaver_ will use the system time. For your current location, you will still
have to specify the `--lat` and `--long` options.

For more options and help run `starsaver -h` or `starsaver --help`

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Use a tool like https://www.latlong.net/ to get your latitude and longitude
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Star magnitudes decrease as apparent brightness increases
