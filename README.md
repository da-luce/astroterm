# üåå astroterm ![Test Status](https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/da-luce/astroterm/graph/badge.svg?token=80C0ZQBVTM)](https://codecov.io/gh/da-luce/astroterm)

`astroterm` is a terminal-based celestial viewer written in `C` using `ncurses`. It displays the real-time positions of stars, planets, constellations, and more, all within your terminal‚Äîno telescope required! Configure sky views by date, time, and location with precise ASCII-rendered visuals. See [usage](#usage) for all supported options!

`astroterm` is constantly improving, and we'd love to hear your ideas! If you have a suggestion or find a bug, please open an issue and share your feedback.

## Installation

Several installation methods are provided based on your platform. If none of these fit your needs, you can always [build from source](#building-from-source). Refer to [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for help resolving any issues.

### Linux

#### Prebuilt Executable

1. Download the latest executable using `wget`

    ```sh
    wget -O astroterm-linux_x86_64 "https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases/latest/download/astroterm-linux-x86_64"
    ```

2. Run the executable

    ```sh
    ./astroterm-linux-x84_64
    ```

### MacOS

#### Prebuilt Executable

1. Download the latest executable for your system architecture using `wget`

    ```sh
    wget -O astroterm-darwin-<arch>.zip "https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases/latest/download/astroterm-darwin-<arch>.zip"
    ```

   - Replace `<arch>` with the appropriate architecture:
     - **Apple Silicon (M-series):** `astroterm-darwin-aarch64`
     - **Intel-based Macs:** `astroterm-darwin-x86_64`

2. Run the executable

    ```sh
    ./astroterm-darwin-<arch>
    ```

### Windows

#### Prebuilt Executable

1. Download the latest `.exe` file using PowerShell's `Invoke-WebRequest`:

    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases/latest/download/astroterm-windows-x86_64.exe" -OutFile "astroterm-windows-x86_64.exe"
    ```

2. Run the `.exe`

    ```powershell
    .\astroterm-windows-x86_64.exe
    ```

Or, download via the [Releases Page](https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases).

## Building from Source

### Linux, macOS & WSL

#### Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When building, you must install the _development_ version of the runtime requirements, which provide the headers and libraries necessary for compiling and linking. These packages are typically marked with a `-dev` or `-devel` suffix.

- Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL, etc.)
- C compiler
- [`meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) 1.4.0 or newer ([installation via python](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#installation-using-python) is recommended)
- [`ninja`](https://repology.org/project/ninja/versions) 1.8.2 or newer
- [`ncurses`](https://repology.org/project/ncurses/versions) library
- [`argtable2`](https://repology.org/project/argtable2/versions)
- Some common CLI tools
  - [`wget`](https://repology.org/project/wget/versions) or [`curl`](https://repology.org/project/curl/versions)
  - [`xxd`](https://repology.org/project/xxd/versions) (is also commonly packaged with [`vim`](https://repology.org/project/vim/versions))

> [!WARNING]
> `ncurses` and `argtable` detection is spotty on some systems, and you may need to install
> [`pkg-config`](https://repology.org/project/pkg-config/versions) in order
> for Meson to find them.

> [!TIP]
> See [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) for how `astroterm` is built and tested on Ubuntu via GitHub Actions.

#### Install

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm && cd astroterm
  ```

2. Download star data:

  ```sh
  curl -L -o data/bsc5 http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/BSC5
  ```

3. Build:

  ```sh
  meson setup build
  meson compile -C build
  ```

You may now run the generated `./build/astroterm` binary or add the `astroterm` command system-wide via `meson install -C build`. Pressing <kbd>q</kbd> or <kbd>ESC</kbd> will exit the display.

### Windows (not recommended)

#### Requirements

- [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/) (Other C compilers currently don't work)
- [`meson`](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson) 1.4.0 or newer ([installation via python](https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html#installation-using-python) is recommended)
- [`ninja`](https://repology.org/project/ninja/versions) 1.8.2 or newer
- [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for embedding data during build)
- [`pdcurses`](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses/tree/master/wincon)*
- [`argtable2`](https://github.com/jonathanmarvens/argtable2)*

> [!WARNING]
> *These libraries must be compiled locally and moved to where Meson expects them to be. See [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml#L98) for how this is done.

1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm && cd astroterm
  ```

2. Download star data:

  ```sh
  curl -L -o data/bsc5 http://tdc-www.harvard.edu/catalogs/BSC5
  ```

3. Build:

  ```sh
  meson setup build
  meson compile -C build
  ```

> [!TIP]
> Some steps must be done in the [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt and Developer PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022), so it's best to just do everything there.

## Usage

Example output:

### Options

The `--help` flag displays all supported options:

```text

                            lable cities, see: https://github.com/da-luce/astro

```

### Example

Say we wanted to view the sky at 5:00 AM (Eastern) on July 16, 1969‚Äîthe morning
of the Apollo 11 launch at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. We would run:

```sh
astroterm --latitude 28.573469 --longitude -80.651070 --datetime 1969-7-16T8:00:00
```

Finding the precise coordinates can be cumbersome, so we could also use the nearest major city to achieve a similar result:

```sh
astroterm --city Orlando --datetime 1969-7-16T8:00:00 -m
```

While we're still waiting for someone to invent time travel, we can cheat a little by using [Stellarium](https://stellarium-web.org/skysource/UpsPeg?fov=185.00&date=1969-07-19T09:00:00Z&lat=28.47&lng=-80.56&elev=0) to confirm that this aligns with reality.

If we then wanted to display constellations and add color, we would add `--constellations --color` as options.

If you simply want the current time, don't specify the `--datetime` option and
`astroterm` will use the system time. For your current location, you will still
have to specify the `--lat` and `--long` options, or provide the nearest city with the `--city` option.

For more options and help, run `astroterm -h` or `astroterm --help`.

> [!TIP]
> Use a tool like [LatLong](https://www.latlong.net/) to get your latitude and longitude.

> [!TIP]
> Star magnitudes decrease as apparent brightness increases, i.e., to show more stars, increase the threshold.

## Troubleshooting

### Release Won't Download via Curl

For some reason, `curl` does not follow the latest release redirect. Use `wget`
to download the latest release or hardcode the tag in the link using `curl`. Or,
just download via the [releases page](https://github.com/da-luce/astroterm/releases).

### Broken Unicode on Linux

If Unicode characters do not display correctly in the terminal, you may need to configure your system's locale to support Unicode.

1. Temporarily set the locale (add this to `.bashrc` or equivalent to permanently enforce)

  ```bash
  export LC_ALL="en_US.UTF-8"
  export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
  ```

2. Install and configure locales (example for Ubuntu/Debian)

  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y locales
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
  ```

  During configuration, select `en_US.UTF-8` as the default locale.

### Broken Resizing on Windows

Currently, resizing the terminal on Windows is not functioning properly due to known incompatibilities. At this time, no solutions are available. Contributions or suggestions to address this issue are greatly appreciated.

## Development

### Testing

Run `meson test` within the build directory. To get a coverage report, subsequently run `ninja coverage`.
